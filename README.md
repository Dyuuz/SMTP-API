# 📧 Serverless Email API (Zoho SMTP)

This project provides a lightweight HTTP API for sending emails using Zoho Mail SMTP. It supports CORS, JSON requests, input validation, and both plain text + HTML messages.

To improve reliability, it also includes solutions for environments where SMTP may not work due to restricted networks, firewalls, or cloud service limitations. This is achieved by:

Supporting fallback to Zoho’s REST Mail API when SMTP is blocked.

Offering configurable SMTP relay ports (465, 587, 2525) to bypass firewall restrictions.

Allowing integration with secure mail relay services or tunneling mechanisms to ensure message delivery in restricted environments.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Accepts GET, POST, and OPTIONS requests

✅ Validates required fields before sending

✅ Supports plain text + HTML email bodies

✅ CORS enabled (can be called from frontend apps directly)

✅ Runs on serverless platforms (Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, etc.)

✅ Secure authentication with Zoho Mail

# 🔐 Security Notes

Always use a Zoho App Password, not your main Zoho account password.

Store sensitive values like SENDER_EMAIL and SENDER_PASSWORD in environment variables on your serverless platform.

Do not hardcode credentials in your code.


🛠️ Deploying

1. Vercel

Put handler.py inside api/ directory.

Add Zoho credentials as environment variables in Vercel dashboard.

Deploy — your endpoint will be available at:

https://yourproject.vercel.app/api/handler


2. Netlify Functions

Place the file under netlify/functions/handler.py.

Configure Netlify to handle Python functions.

Deploy — endpoint will be at:

https://yourproject.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/handler

# 📌 Example Usage (JavaScript Fetch)
```
fetch("https://yourproject.vercel.app/api/handler", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(
  {
    SUBJECT: "Hello",
    MESSAGE: "Plain text version",
    SENDER_EMAIL: "your@zoho.com",
    SENDER_PASSWORD: "zoho_app_password",
    RECEIVER_EMAIL: "user@example.com",
    HTML_MESSAGE: "<h1>Hello</h1><p>This is HTML</p>"
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error);
